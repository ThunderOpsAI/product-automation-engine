Success Metrics – Product Automation Engine
Week 1 – Validation Phase

Objective: Prove pipeline works end-to-end.

≥ 30 OpportunityBrief objects generated

≥ 5 niches with confidence_score ≥ 7

≥ 3 approved for build

0 compliance violations

Agent error rate < 5%

Health checks:

tasks.failed / total_tasks < 0.05

approval queue cleared daily

Week 2 – Initial Market Entry

Objective: Validate product-market resonance.

≥ 5 products listed

≥ 50 total product views

≥ 1 sale

Conversion rate ≥ 0.5%

Refund rate ≤ 10%

Listing success rate = 100% (no API failures)

System signals:

All Enhancement agents produce quality_score ≥ 8

Branding confidence_score ≥ 7 for ≥ 80% of products

If conversion < 0.5%:
→ Trigger Optimization Agent automatically

Week 4 – Traction Confirmation

Objective: Prove repeatability.

≥ 10 products live

≥ 150 total views

≥ 10 total sales

Conversion rate ≥ 0.8%

Revenue ≥ $200 gross

Refund rate ≤ 8%

≥ 1 product with ≥ 3 sales

Pipeline health:

No product with > 100 views and 0 sales

Approval queue turnaround < 24h

If:

Views high + sales zero → Conversion issue

Views low → Traffic issue

Month 2 – System Viability

Objective: Demonstrate scalable engine.

≥ 20 products live

≥ $1,000 gross revenue

≥ $700 net revenue

Conversion rate ≥ 1%

Refund rate ≤ 5%

≥ 3 products with ≥ 5 sales each

Bundle revenue ≥ 10% of total

System metrics:

Automation rate ≥ 85% (no human intervention required)

Agent confidence average ≥ 7.5

Optimization experiments improving CVR ≥ 20% relative lift

Kill criteria:

Any product refund rate > 15% → auto pause listing

Any niche with 0 sales after 45 days → archive

Month 3 – Engine Stability

Objective: Compounding revenue behavior.

≥ 30 products live

≥ $2,000 monthly gross

≥ 1 product generating ≥ $300/month

Conversion ≥ 1.2%

Refund rate ≤ 4%

System maturity:

Approval events < 10% of total tasks

API failure rate < 2%

A/B experiments running continuously
